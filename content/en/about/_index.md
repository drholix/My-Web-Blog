I'm **Alief "Awan" Kurniawan**, a Blue Team specialist based in Depok, Indonesia. Most days I run SIEM operations, lead incident response bridges, and hunt through telemetry from Wazuh, Elastic, and Splunk. I enjoy shaping detection content, automating response with GitOps pipelines, and translating complex forensics into plain updates for stakeholders.

Outside the war room I mentor at cybersecurity workshops, publish playbooks, and co-design tabletop exercises for local communities. My current areas of focus include detection engineering, SOC workflow design, and building resilient monitoring stacks for distributed teams.

If you're looking to **read real incident stories**, dive into **portfolio projects**, or **collaborate on Blue Team initiatives**, you'll find the right links throughout this site and in the footer. Let's keep defenders ahead of the curve.
