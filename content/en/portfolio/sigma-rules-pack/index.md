I maintain a Sigma pack aligned to our top threats:

- Techniques mapped to ATT&CK TTPs with detection coverage scores exported from Elastic.
- CI pipeline tests rule syntax, sample logs, and duplication before merge.
- Releases ship with Markdown playbooks and MITRE matrices for quick stakeholder review.

The pack powers our detection-as-code initiative and keeps drift under control.
