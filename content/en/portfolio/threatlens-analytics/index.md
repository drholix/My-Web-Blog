I built a ThreatLens dashboard that merges vendor feeds with internal telemetry so analysts can react faster:

- Integrated MISP, CISA KEV, and local honeypot results into a unified queue.
- Generated ATT&CK heatmaps, Sigma coverage scores, and open remediation tickets.
- Exported weekly digests via Netlify Functions straight into Slack and email lists.

The result is a 360Â° view of who is targeting us, how prepared we are, and which playbooks must be updated next.
