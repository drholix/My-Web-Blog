During an incident, communication speed dictates resolution time. This is the template I send:

- **Subject:** _[IR][SEVERITY] - [System] - [Short summary]_ 
- **Body:** brief chronology, impact, initial mitigation, required assistance.
- **Attachment:** timeline and relevant logs.

{{< alert type="warning" title="Drill" >}}
Run a quarterly tabletop to make sure every stakeholder can send and receive these updates.
{{< /alert >}}

With this layout executives get the necessary status without follow-up questions.
