When a suspicious sample arrives, time is limited. This workflow keeps triage under 30 minutes:

1. **Intake:** hash the file, query VirusTotal, and scan with YARA rules mapped to the latest campaigns.
2. **Dynamic analysis:** detonate in a sandbox (Any.Run or Local VM) with network capture turned on.
3. **Containment signal:** if the behavior touches credential stores or lateral movement, escalate to incident response immediately.

```bash
# baseline yara execution
python yara_scan.py --rules ./rules/blue-team-index.yar --sample suspicious.exe --report reports/suspicious.json
```

{{< alert type="info" title="Tip" >}}
Keep your sandbox snapshots lean (fresh OS, no enterprise agents) to avoid interference with the sample.

Document every verdict in the case management system so reverse engineers have full context before they dive into IDA.
