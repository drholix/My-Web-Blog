To keep my hunting reflex sharp I rotate through these labs:

1. **Velociraptor Detection Lab** — focuses on Windows artifacts.
2. **Elastic Detections Workshop** — explores behavior analytics.
3. **Mordor Attack Data Sets** — offers realistic datasets.

Each session ends with a post-mortem so the outcomes land in our knowledge base.
